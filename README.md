\Data Flow Architecture...
User Input ‚Üí AddMood Component ‚Üí Local Cache ‚Üí Firestore Sync ‚Üí Real-time Updates ‚Üí Analytics Charts

Key Data Flow Steps:
- User inputs mood data via AddMood form
- Local cache saves for offline use
- Online check and Firestore sync
- Real-time listeners update components
- Charts visualize aggregated data



## üìã Assignment Requirements Implemented

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Project Setup & Firebase Integration
Project Initialization:
Created an Ionic React project using the tabs template:
ionic start mindbalance-app tabs --type=react
Then navigated to the project directory and installed Firebase.
cd mindbalance-app
npm install firebase

Firebase Setup:
Configured Firestore for cloud-based data storage.
Added a .env file to securely manage Firebase credentials using environment variables.
Created a firebaseConfig.ts file for modular and reusable Firebase initialization.


### ‚úÖ Task 2: CRUD Functionality (Mood Entries)
Implemented complete Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality for mood tracking:
Create:
Users can add new mood entries with notes via AddMood.tsx.

Read:
Displayed a real-time, chronologically sorted mood list in MoodList.tsx, synced with Firestore.

Update:
Enabled editing of existing mood entries directly from the mood list (MoodList.tsx).

Delete:
Provided functionality to remove mood entries from the mood list (MoodList.tsx).

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Client-Side Caching
Implemented offline data persistence and synchronization:

Storage Setup:
Installed and configured Ionic Storage:
npm install @ionic/storage
Then created a reusable Storage.ts utility module.

Caching Logic:
Goal: Ensure fast load times and offline access to previously fetched data.
Modified MoodList.tsx to:
Load cached mood data first (instant display).
Fetch live data from Firestore afterward and synchronize changes.
Maintain consistency between local cache and remote database.

Final App Structure:
Home.tsx: Acts as the main navigation hub.
App.tsx: Root component handling routing, initialization, and overall app structure.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Ionic CLI (`npm install -g @ionic/cli`)

How to run it .
Test Your Repo
1. Delete my local `node_modules/` folder  
2. Run `npm install` again ‚Üí make sure project still works  
3. Run `ionic serve` ‚Üí after typing cd mindbalance-app to direct the folder and then to type ionic serve confirm everything runs clean  
The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:8100
